# MazeGame
Simple maze game in Java.

Utilizes union-find data struture along with Kruskal's Algorithm with path compression heuristics
to create the minimum spanning tree that is used for the maze design.

Player can either utilize the arrow keys to guied the player(yellow circle), or press "B" to have the maze solve itself
using breadth-first search, or "D" to have the maze solve itself using a depth-first search.

Both searches graphically represent the search and display the optimal path to the finish upon completion.
